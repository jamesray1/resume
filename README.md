## Incentivizing Waste Reduction
Founder, Feb 2019 to March 2019

This was a brief period looking into weight-based pricing for waste. Gaining traction with the proposal would involve a council trialing it, which requires political will. Hence, sign [this petition](https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_Incentivize_waste_reduction_by_weighing_general_waste_and_charging_for_the_weight/)!

## Crypto sector experience

June 2017–Feb 2019

Due to insufficient funding for gossipsub and Eth 2 development, after working on these projects and contributing in the Ethereum sector part-time then full time since June 2017 and Feb 2018, respectively, trying unsuccessfully to get a suitable job or grants, I'm looking for a job. I'm focusing on getting a job in the renewable energy industry, as this
is where I have the most experience. There also aren't as many jobs in this sector compared to the renewable industry. I worked in this sector because I saw that it had a lot of potential to empower individuals and organizations through the decentralized web and finance. See [here](crypto-industry-experience.md) for more information (FMI).

## Renewable energy experience

### Technical Support Engineer / Customer Service Representative at Sungrow

March 2016—February 2018

See <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/work-log/blob/master/Sungrow-log.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;for tasks completed, and <a href="https://sustergy.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/finishing-position-at-sungrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for the reason for leaving.

### Solar Engineer at Solar Energy Enterprises

Two days a week from 12 July 2017—29 August 2017 with Solar Energy Enterprises and Clean Energy Corporation doing residential and solar solar project management, which included roof feasibility studies for solar installation and grid applications. I finished the work by my choice because I wanted to focus more time on Ethereum, and could've been working full-time at Sungrow if I had wanted to (which I didn't).

### Independent researcher on the sustainable energy industry

2011–2016 (this includes a Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable energy from 2011–14).

Notes on my findings can be found <a href="https://sustergy.co/sustainable-energy-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Researching sustainable innovation from the idea stage of the technology life cycle through to commercial maturity. I do this to find areas that I would be most interested in contributing my time, energy and money to in order to maximise positive impact.

### Project/Engineering Assistant at Todae Solar

Nov 2015

This was a feasibility study or pre-design. More information is available [here](project-assistant-todate-solar.md).

### Product Development Manager at Solar Energy Enterprises

I worked about 4 hours a week for several weeks in mid-2015 as a product development manager. See [here](product-development-manager-SEE.md) FMI.

I also provided sales assistance and technical support at an expo and as a door-to-door lead generator doorknocker in late 2014 / early 2015.

### Operations/Engineering Assistant at Solar Analytics

I worked in a full-time position from the 23rd of February 2015 to the 13th of March 2015. See [here](operations-assistant-solar-analytics) FMI.

### Village Infrastructure

I was a consultant pitching for funds for a contest for solar agroprocessing in developing countries. This was more of a project that took about a few days work in around late 2015.

### Founding Principal Tutor at TuWorks

July 2012–2016

Tutoring students from preschool to master's level in renewable energy engineering at UNSW. Tutored several university students. Subjects that I have taught include: academic writing, renewable energy engineering courses such as Wind Energy Converters and Electricity Industry Operation and Control; Excel, chemistry, physics, maths, English.

## Education

Bachelor of Engineering (Renewable Energy) at the University of New South Wales, 2011–2014. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/JMesqzjt4AcnW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a link to an outdated version of my academic transcript</a>, although the WAM of 72.7 isn't particularly impressive. I have graduated and need to upload the latest version.

Honours thesis: a technical, economic, and policy analysis of sustainable energy measures for homes. The thesis is available <a href="https://1sustainablelife.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/energy-wise-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

I have also done extensive self-study for blockchains, sustainable energy, and with online courses such as Coursera (these are detailed on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameschristopherray/)).

## My "training ground"

Warehouse dispatch as an entry level store team member at Woolworths Mascot Online (10 February 2017–4 May 2017); gardening for several clients from roughly 2005–2015; candidate sourcing; marketing; sales; retail; project management; cleaning; data entry; forklift operation license; and general labour.
