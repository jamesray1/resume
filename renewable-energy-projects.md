### Solar Engineer at Solar Energy Enterprises

Two days a week from 12 July 2017—29 August 2017 doing residential and solar solar project management, which included roof feasibility studies for solar installation and grid applications. I finished the work by my choice because I wanted to focus more time on Ethereum, and could've been working full-time at Sungrow if I had wanted to (which I didn't).

### Independent researcher on the sustainable energy industry

2011–2016 (this includes a Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable energy from 2011–14).

This was more of a project that took about a few days work in around late 2015. I was a consultant pitching for funds for a contest for solar agroprocessing in developing countries.
